there are 4 types of summarization 
1.basic prompt summarization:-main aim is just to give simple prompt and do the summarization that any kind of data we have

difference between the basic text prompt summarization and the prompt template summarization
1. in basic we directly ask the model to summarize a given text i simply copy paste text into propmpt and ask model to summarize.

2.in prompt template text summarization the templates provide clear instructions,signaling the text that i intend to summarize.
The use of a template can help prevent the mixing up of instructions and input, which can lead to undesired outcomes3. It also 
allows for more customization and can be more effective in generating desired results

In summary, while basic prompt text summarization is simpler and more direct, prompt template text summarization offers more 
control and can be more effective, especially for complex summarization tasks
